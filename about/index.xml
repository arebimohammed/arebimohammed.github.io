      <description>I LOVE DATA! From a very early age Iâ€™ve been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take part in anything to see how it worked, tried to figure out the problem and find ways to solve it, I was very curious but driven as well. I grew up with this trait and other similar traits one of them being analytical, which shaped my ambitions today in being a data analyst/scientist and anything related to that field.</description>
