# About Me

<br><br>



I LOVE DATA! <br> 

From a very early age Iâ€™ve been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take part in anything to see how it worked, tried to figure out the problem and find ways to solve it, I was very curious but driven as well. I grew up with this trait and other similar traits one of them being analytical, which shaped my ambitions today in being a data analyst/scientist and anything related to that field. 
<br><br>
I was able to gain good experience in internships and projects (see <a style="text-decoration: underline;"  href="/projects/my-projects">Projects Page</a>), where I learned skills like Python, Machine Learning, Statistics and calculus, SQL and Power BI. 
I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at the <a style = "text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.hs-furtwangen.de"> Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences</a>
<br><br>
I am passionate about innovation, and using data science to help companies and communities thrive.

I'm a data-driven and insightful student who is passionate about growing his skillset and working on meaningful projects. 
If I'm not cleaning data, understanding data, or pivoting tables of data, I'm working out, watching documentaries, playing football, hanging out with friends, and sipping on apple juice (Love that too).
