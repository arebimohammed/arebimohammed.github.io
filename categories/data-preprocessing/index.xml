            </div>I mentioned various undersampling approaches for dealing with highly imbalanced data in the earlier post &ldquo;Using Under-Sampling Techniques for Extremely Imbalanced Data.&rdquo; In this article, I present oversampling strategies for dealing with the same problem.
By reproducing minority class examples, oversampling raises the weight of the minority class. Although it does not provide information, it introduces the issue of over-fitting, which causes the model to be overly specific. It is possible that while the accuracy for the training set is great, the performance for unseenÂ datasets is poor.]]></description>

            </div>Class imbalance can lead to a significant bias toward the dominant class, lowering classification performance and increasing the frequency of false negatives. How can we solve the problem? The most popular strategies include data resampling, which involves either undersampling the majority of the class, oversampling the minority class, or a combination of the two. As a consequence, classification performance will improve. In this article, I will describe what unbalanced data is, why Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) fails to measure accurately, and how to address the problem.]]></description>
