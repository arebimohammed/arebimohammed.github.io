            </div>Introduction The logistic model (or logit model) in statistics is a statistical model that represents the probability of an event occurring by making the log-odds for the event a linear combination of one or more independent variables.
Logistic regression is another approach borrowed from statistics by machine learning. It is the go-to strategy for binary classification problems (problems with two classes) even though it is a regression algorithm (predicts probabilities, more on that later).]]></description>
