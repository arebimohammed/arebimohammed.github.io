# Why I started Blogging

<!--more-->

I've been studying machine learning, data analysis and all-stuff data for almost a year now. It's been an exciting journey, I got to talk to interesting people, work on meaningful projects but most importantly learn, which is really my favourite activity. Plus, my passion for data and being able to use it in worthwhile ways, that will help others grew significantly. I already had an impulse to patterns, numbers, math and reasoning which definitely helped shape my ambition in learning machine learning, data analysis and pursuing a career in data science, not because it was labelled "The Sexiest Job Of The 21st Century" by the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) back in 2012.

After this small but growing journey, I decided to document it, in the form of blog posts. I worked on several projects so I will be talking about them and sharing them. I tried and still try to understand different algorithms and techniques in my own way, so I will write about them in my own way of thinking. I will also be working on new projects, and I'll try my best to share them as well.

There are other several reasons why I decided to start my own blog, here are some of them:

- It can help others. Others may benefit from the way I went about several of my own projects and my own way of understanding different concepts.

- It helps me get feedback on my work. While my blog posts can help others, I am not perfect and I might have gotten something wrong and any feedback from others can help me better myself.

- It's like a portfolio/resume of my work but even better! Because not only do I showcase my skills I can get directly contacted for job offers. I've used my previous projects with my previous employers to land several jobs.

- It helps me learn. Organizing information always aids me in formulating my own thoughts. One of the ways to tell if I understand something is to explain it to someone, and I do that all the time with others, but now just only in blog posts.

- It can also help me get to know others and even collaborate.

I've made a summary on my previous work with the help of my projects, and notes. I'll be using this summary to help me write these blog posts and maybe even enhance/update my previous work, and I advise anyone in the field of data science to try and do the same thing, there's really nothing negative that can come from it, it doesn't have to be an article a day, or even an article a week, you can do it at your own pace and build it up slowly.

I will be writing about:

- Projects I have worked on 

- Data analysis and business intelligence: from data cleaning, pre-processing, visualization, interactivity, applied statistics and data analysis tools.

- Machine Learning Algorithms: Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.

- Deep Learning: Backpropagation, Activation Functions, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc.

- And who knows there might be new topics I would like to write about, only time will tell ðŸ˜‰.

I hope I got your attention, and you are willing to embark with me in my journey. I am super excited to write, code and share all the work I have been working on and will be working on. You can of course subscribe to my [feed](/sub.html) and get all the latest blog posts as soon as they are uploaded to my website. I also write in Medium here: [@arebi.mohamed59](https://medium.com/@arebi.mohamed59). All my other social links such as GitHub and LinkedIn are to be found at the bottom of this page.

Thank you for reading and see you on soon in the next article. Stay Safe!
